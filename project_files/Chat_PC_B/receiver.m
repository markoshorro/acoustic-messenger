	%% RECEIVER FUNCTION
    % Group 13
    % Introduction to Communication Engineering. September 2015 
    %
    % Implementation of the receiver.
    % INPUT:  tout  - type double and defines the time during while
    %                 waiting
    %         fc    - carrier frequency
    %
    % OUTPUT: Xhat  - Xhat is a row-vector of 432 bits (0, 1) of the
    %                 received information.
    %         psd   - psd is a structure with two fields: psd.p is a row
    %                 vector of the PSD of the received signal calculated
    %                 after down-conversion in dB. The vector psd.p is normalized
    %                 that normalized so that maximum value is 0 dB. psd.f is a
    %                 row-vector of corresponding frequencies in Hz
    %         const - row-vector of complex samples after downsampling that 
    %                 correspond to information par
    %         eyed  - eyed.fsfd is an integer and stands for a number of 
    %                 samples per symbol; eyed.r is a complex row-vector of
    %                 information part of the received signal after matched
    %                 filtering and timing synchronization (properly cut so
    %                 that MATLAB eyediagram(eyed.r, eyed.fsfd) plots a 
    %                 desired eye diagram).
